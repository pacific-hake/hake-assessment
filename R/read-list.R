  ## Read the data from the file 'fn' into a list and return the list.
  ## File structure: *Like an ADMB REP file*
  ## It is assumed that each text label will be on its own line,
  ##  followed by one or more lines of data.
  ## If the label is followed by a single value or line of data,
  ##  a vector will be created to hold the data.
  ## If the label is followed by multiple lines of data,
  ##  a matrix will be created to hold the data. The matrix might be
  ##  ragged so a check is done ahead of time to ensure correct
  ##  matrix dimensions.
  ## If a label has another label following it but no data,
  ##  that label is thrown away and not included in the returned list.
  ## A label must start with an alphabetic character followed by
  ## any number of alphanumeric characters (includes underscore and .)
