# Request 6
**Present the fish age throughout the 2025 season for each sector. Presenting age would remove confounding growth. Monthly would be preferred, but could be spring/summer/fall, or simply early and late, if necessary.**

**Justification:** This will address a question from the public and inform the SRG on differences in catch throughout the season. It will also help to identify when the age-1 fish became prominent and may help to understand why certain percentages are in the data but may not be in the prediction or in what stakeholders perceived for the season.
