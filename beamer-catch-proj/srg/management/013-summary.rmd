# Summary

## Summary of management outcomes

* Based on the default harvest rule, the estimated median catch limit
  for `r min(forecast_yrs)` is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]` t
  (with 95% interval from `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to
  `r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]` t) (slide 8)

* Projections strongly influenced by size of the above-average 2021 and 2022
  cohorts

* Fishery data indicates a good amount of catch from the 2023 cohort, though these data
  are not accounted for in this model (slide 10)

* There is `r prob_decl_yr1_zero_catch`% chance that spawning biomass will
  decline from `r forecast_yrs[1]` to `r forecast_yrs[2]` with zero catch
  and >99% chance of decline for all other catch streams (slide 15) under
  the assumption of median recruitment from 2023 onwards

## Uncertainty around 2021 cohort is large

                xmax = 2021.5,
                ymin = 3,
                ymax = 28),
