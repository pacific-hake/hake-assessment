# Introduction

## `r assess_yr` base model structure

* The `r assess_yr` model is effectively equivalent to the  `r last_assess_yr` model (unchanged structure and results) to the start of 2025.

* Model parameters are effectively the same for `r assess_yr` and `r last_assess_yr`.

* The same version of Stock Synthesis was used as last year.

* The `r assess_yr` model only includes updated 2025 total coast-wide catch data.

* Often referred to as a catch-only projection style of assessment.

## Justification for `r assess_yr` base model structure

A catch-only projection is appropriate for the 2026 stock assessment for several reasons:

* The 2025 IWCPS acoustic survey biomass and age-composition estimates were finalized only days before the assessment deadline due to a 7-week delay (U.S. lapse in federal appropriations). Consequently, these data did not had the necessary review by the JTC. The 2025 IWCPS survey had meaningful survey design changes. Incorporating these data without proper review by the SRG may result in assumptions that result in biased results.
\item[]
* Data from both the fishery and acoustic survey are complementary and provide a more informative representation of the population. Including the 2025 fishery age compositions without including the 2025 survey biomass estimate (and age compositions) risks introducing biases. In recent years, a tension has been observed between fishery age composition data (suggesting high recruitment from shifts to large proportions of young fish) and the acoustic survey biomass index (suggesting decreasing overall biomass). 
\item[]
* The next full stock assessment should include the full complement of properly scrutinized data informing both cohort strengths and absolute biomass.

## Key observations

Stock assessment model

* Catch increased from last year, now near the time series average
* Recent age composition data (up to 2022) indicates increasing biomass
* Recent acoustic survey data (up to 2023) indicates decreasing biomass
* Combined, population trend relatively stable over last few years
* Stock status is above `r b_40`, with 80% probability 

Outside the assessment model

* Indication of low overall hake biomass from preliminary 2025 survey estimates
* Indication of good recruitment for 2023 cohort, but assessment assumes median levels
* Indication of high overall hake biomass from fishery age compositions
* Combined, unknown until next full assessment
* Economics of fishing not sustainable in areas
* Ecosystem and environmental conditions -- neutral
