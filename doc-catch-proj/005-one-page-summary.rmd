# One-page summary {-}

- The stock assessment for `r assess_yr` uses the model and parameter estimates
  from the `r last_assess_yr` assessment, projected forward to the start of 
  `r assess_yr` using the coast-wide fishery catch from `r last_data_yr`.  

- The biomass estimate and age data from the 2025 Joint 
  U.S.-Canada Integrated West Coast Pelagics Survey were not available in time to
  be incorporated into a fully updated assessment model, as a result of the extended
  U.S. federal government shutdown in `r last_data_yr`. Furthermore, it has yet
  to be determined how to incorporate the new biomass estimate and data into the
  existing survey time series in a compatible way, because of changes in survey 
  design.   

- The `r last_assess_yr` assessment model, with data through
  2024, was fit to an acoustic survey index of biomass,
  annual commercial catch data, and age-composition data from the survey and
  commercial fisheries. A model-based approach was used for the input
  weight-at-age matrix and time-varying temperature-dependent maturity, both of
  which informed fecundity. Fishery catch is the only updated `r last_assess_yr` data in the `r assess_yr` stock assessment.

- Coast-wide catch in `r end_yr-1` was `r last_yr_landings`~t
(t represents tonnes), 48% below the average over the most recent 10 years
(`r ct |> tail(10) |> pull(Total) |> mean() |> f()`~t),
out of a total allowable catch (TAC), adjusted for carryovers, of
`r last_yr_tac` t. The U.S. caught `r last_yr_us_landings`~t
(`r last_yr_us_attained`% of their quota) and Canada caught
`r last_yr_can_landings`~t (`r last_yr_can_attained`% of their quota).

- The projected median of the `r end_yr` relative spawning biomass
(female spawning biomass at the start of `r end_yr` divided by that at
unfished equilibrium, `r b_0`) is `r curr_depl_median`% but it is highly
uncertain (with 95% credible interval from `r curr_depl_lower`% to
`r curr_depl_upper`%). 

- The projected median of female spawning biomass at the start
of `r end_yr` is `r curr_bio_median_tonnes`~t (with 95% credible
interval from `r curr_bio_lower_tonnes` to `r curr_bio_upper_tonnes`~t).

- The estimated probability that female spawning biomass at the start of
`r assess_yr` is below the `r b_40` (40% of `r b_0`) reference point is
`r probs_curr_below_b40`%, and the probability that the relative fishing
intensity exceeded 1 in `r end_yr - 1` is
`r probs_curr_rel_fish_intens_above_1`%. The joint
probability of both these occurring is `r joint_percent_prob_above_below`%.

- Based on the default harvest rule, the estimated median catch limit for
`r min(forecast_yrs)` is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]`~t (with
95% credible interval from `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to
`r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]`~t).

- Projections were conducted across a wide-range of catch levels for a single year.
The projection setting the `r forecast_yrs[1]` catch equal to the 
`r forecast_yrs[1] - 1` 
coast-wide TAC of `r last_yr_tac` t shows the estimated median relative
spawning biomass decreasing from `r f(last_yr_tac_fore_1_biomass)`% in
`r end_yr` to `r f(last_yr_tac_fore_2_biomass)`% in `r end_yr + 1`,
<!-- with a `r last_yr_tac_risk_2_bforty`% chance -->
<!-- of the female spawning biomass falling below `r b_40` in `r end_yr + 2`. -->
<!-- There is an estimated `r last_yr_tac_risk_1_biomass_decline`% chance of the -->
<!-- female spawning biomass declining from `r end_yr` to `r end_yr + 1`, an -->
<!-- `r last_yr_tac_risk_2_biomass_decline`% chance of it declining from -->
<!-- `r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + 2`, and an -->
<!-- `r last_yr_tac_risk_3_biomass_decline`% chance of it declining -->
<!-- from `r end_yr + 2` to `r end_yr + 3` with a constant catch of -->
<!-- `r last_yr_tac` t. -->
With a realized catch of 250,000 t in `r assess_yr`, it was estimated that the
stock has a 33% <!-- TODO HARDWIRED -->
chance of falling below  `r b_40` at the start of
2027, given the current assumption of average recruitment from 2023 onward.

- Despite the projections of a current stock status likely above `r b_40`, the recent lack
of survey abundance and fishery catch in Canada suggests
a population structure not conducive to achieving harvest quotas in
northern fisheries over recent years.
