## Stock {-}

TODO: Text here is unedited from last year's Executive summary.

This assessment reports the status of the coastal `r sp` (or `r common_name`,
*`r science_name`*) stock off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and Canada
at the start of `r assess_yr`. This stock exhibits seasonal migratory
behavior, ranging from offshore and generally southern waters during the
winter spawning season to coastal areas between northern California and
northern British Columbia during the spring, summer, and fall when the
fishery is conducted. The stock tends to move farther to the north during the
summer in years with warmer water compared to years with colder waters. Older
`r sp` tend to migrate farther north than younger `r sp` in all years, with
catches in Canadian waters typically consisting of fish greater than four years
old. Separate, and much smaller, populations of `r sp` occurring in the major
inlets of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, including the Strait of Georgia, Puget
Sound, and the Gulf of California, are not included in this analysis.
