# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

This assessment reports the status of the coastal `r sp` (or `r common_name`,
*`r science_name`*) stock off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and Canada
at the start of `r assess_yr`. This stock exhibits seasonal migratory
behavior, ranging from offshore and generally southern waters during the
winter spawning season to coastal areas between northern California and
northern British Columbia during the spring, summer, and fall when the
fishery is conducted. The stock tends to move farther to the north during the
summer in years with warmer water compared to years with colder waters. Older
`r sp` tend to migrate farther north than younger `r sp` in all years, with
catches in Canadian waters typically consisting of fish greater than four years
old. Separate, and much smaller, populations of `r sp` occurring in the major
inlets of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, including the Strait of Georgia, Puget
Sound, and the Gulf of California, are not included in this analysis.

The base model for this Joint Technical Committee (JTC) assessment is the base
model from the `r last_data_yr` stock assessment [@JTC2025], projected forward
to the start of `r assess_yr` using the fishery catches from `r last_data_yr`. 
There is no updated fitting of the model to data; thus all parameter estimates
are the same as given in @JTC2025. 
No other `r last_data_yr` data were added to the assessment model,
though available updated data are presented in Appendix~\@ref(sec:tables)
and Appendix~\@ref(sec:figures) for reference. This type of stock assessment is often
referred to as a catch-only projection. It is a widespread method used to
provide updated management advice given updates to recent catch history while
using an already approved stock assessment.

The `r last_data_yr` base model was a statistical catch-at-age population
model fit in a Bayesian context using  Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampling via the efficient No-U-Turn Sampler [@JTC2025]. The model assumed 
that the `r sp` population is a single coast-wide stock subject to
one aggregated fleet with combined male and female population dynamics. 
The `r assess_yr` base model therefore has the same assumptions and is then run
forward to the
start of `r assess_yr` using the known catch for `r last_data_yr`. It is
again configured using Stock Synthesis [@MethotWetzel2013] version `r ss_version`. 

Such a catch-only projection assessment for `r assess_yr` was chosen because the
biomass estimate and age data from the 2025 Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated West
Coast Pelagics Survey
were not available in time to be incorporated into a fully updated assessment,
as a result of the extended U.S. federal government shutdown in `r last_data_yr`. Furthermore, it has yet to be
determined how to incorporate the new biomass estimate and data into the existing survey time series in a
compatible way, because of changes in survey design. 
Thus, the JTC decided that conducting the usual fully updated assessment
(i.e. estimating all the parameters again) without complete survey information
would not be appropriate. Such an assessment would be based solely on
fishery-age composition data for two 
consecutive years, whereas usually this only occurs for a single year
(in-between the biannual survey). The absence of new survey information to inform
the model would considerably increase the risk of inaccurate assessment
results being used to inform management decisions.
While quantities of interest could still have been calculated and presented,
this could be potentially misleading because numerical estimates of uncertainty
would ignore the 
major structural uncertainty of having no recent survey biomass estimate.

In this document we present data that are updated from the `r last_data_yr`
assessment, figures and tables related to projections from the `r assess_yr`
base model, a Glossary, U.S. and Canadian Advisory Panel reports summarizing the
`r last_data_yr` fishery, and an updated `r sp`-specific ecosystem summary. Since
there is no new fitting to data, we refer readers to @JTC2025 for details
regarding data that has not been updated, parameter estimates, model
diagnostics, sensitivity analyses, etc.~that have not changed from the 
`r last_data_yr` assessment.
