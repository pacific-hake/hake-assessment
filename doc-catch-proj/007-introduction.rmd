# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

This assessment reports the status of the coastal `r sp` (or `r common_name`,
*`r science_name`*) stock off the west coast of the United States (U.S.) and Canada
at the start of `r assess_yr`. This stock exhibits seasonal migratory
behavior, ranging from offshore and generally southern waters during the
winter spawning season to coastal areas between northern California and
northern British Columbia during the spring, summer, and fall when the
fishery is conducted. The stock tends to move farther to the north during the
summer in years with warmer water compared to years with colder waters. Older
`r sp` tend to migrate farther north than younger `r sp` in all years, with
catches in Canadian waters typically consisting of fish greater than four years
old. Separate, and much smaller, populations of `r sp` occurring in the major
inlets of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, including the Strait of Georgia, Puget
Sound, and the Gulf of California, are not included in this analysis.

This Joint Technical Committee (JTC) assessment is based on
projections from the `r last_data_yr` stock assessment [@JTC2025] estimated population
dynamics, and associated parameter estimates, where the `r last_data_yr` fishery landings
were specifically added as data (i.e., not assumed as in all other projection years
shown in decision tables). No other `r last_data_yr` data were added to the assessment,
though available data can be found in Appendix~\@ref(sec:tables)
and Appendix~\@ref(sec:figures) for reference. This type of stock assessment is often
referred to as a catch-only projection. It is a widespread method used to provide updated management advice given updates to recent catch history while using an already approved stock assessment. The `r assess_yr` assessment is again configured using Stock
Synthesis (version `r ss_version`). 

A projection based assessment for `r assess_yr` was chosen because the acoustic survey
biomass data were not available in time to be incorporated into a fully updated assessment
as a result of the extended U.S. federal government shutdown. Further, it has yet to be
determined how to incorporate the new 2025 Integrated West Coast Pelagic Survey (IWCPS)
estimates into the existing survey time series in a compatible way.  Thus, the JTC
decided that without complete survey information a fully updated assessment based
solely on fishery age composition data alone for two years in a row would considerably
increase the risk for a inaccurate assessment result used to inform management decisions.
