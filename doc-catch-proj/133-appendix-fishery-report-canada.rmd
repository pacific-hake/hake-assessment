# Report of the `r assess_yr - 1` `r sp` fishery in Canada {#sec:app-can-fishery-report}

**Prepared by the Canadian Advisory Panel on January 23, 2026 for inclusion in this assessment document.**

The 2025 Canadian Offshore Pacific Hake fishery catch was the second lowest
recorded since the fishery began in the late 1970s, with 3,988 mt caught at
today’s date. This is a negligible increase from the 3,105 mt caught in 2024 when
compared with the overall coastwide total catch.

The reports from the fishermen were consistent; fishing was very poor as
evident in the extremely low catch. The fleet reported no body of Hake on
the Canadian Zone that allowed for a fishery to take place. What little catch
occurred was in the traditional grounds off Ucluelet. Frozen at-sea (FAS) activity was largely
one vessel only, and they searched the traditional area off Winter Harbour in
the shallows and off the edge, but no fish was found. The fish that were
encountered were again large older +1,000gr. The bycatch was primarily Pollock.
The market for Hake was strong again in 2025, but the catches were not there
to supply the fleet or the plants. The FAS Vessels accounted for an estimated
95% of the catch in 2025.
